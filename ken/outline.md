# List Comprehensions in ECMAScript 6

- Abstract

## Motivation

- Set-builder notation
    - Why this is useful, relevant, etc.
    - Want to use similar notation in computer programs
- Declarative style
    - High level
    - Potential for fewer bugs
    - Potential for fewer SLOC for a given level of complexity

## History

- Early implementations: SETL, NPL
- Genealogy: Miranda -> Haskell -> Python -> Javascript
- PEP 202
    - Python list comprehensions are very similar to Harmony array comprehensions
    - Good history is available on this

## Standards progress

- ECMAScript Working Draft
    - And edits


## Implementation status

## Implications and future predictions
